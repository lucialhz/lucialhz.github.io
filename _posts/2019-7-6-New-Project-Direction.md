title: New Project Direction
---

So I think I will change direction of my project slightly. This is because it will be difficult to contribute to CFI without having good FGPA programming skills, unfortunately this applies to me. So instead I will aim to provide a well rounded problem description, investigate possible solutions and prescribe further work. I won't provide further details on the subject just yet (in case it gets rejected by my project supervisor), however it should still be focussed on control-flow.
